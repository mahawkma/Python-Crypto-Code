# Code for Crypto class CYBR 3570 University Nebraska at Omaha
#Thank you to http://practicalcryptography.com/ for code on ngrams and cracking the simple substitution cypher.

Coded this to help me get through 3570. Please feel free to use, modify, and submit updates. Also, be kind, I was just learning Python when coding this so there may have done some things that may make you scratch your head as I was still pretty clueless. . . :D
